Smart phones equipped with inertial sensors like tri-axial accelerometers and Gyroscope are capable of 
sending (in addition to other services like voice, text, and data) digitized signals measuring motion, 
acceleration, gravity, and body angular position,  which can be processed to identify activities of the 
person carrying the smart phone. Data from an experiment involving 30 participants (Subjects), while 
performing 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) each 
for duration of 15 minutes (with sampling period of 2.5 second), measures the following 17 signals: 

Signal 				Time/Frequency 	Axis

Body Acceleration 			T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
Gravity Acceleration			T		X,Y,Z/
Body acceleration Jerk			T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
Body Angular Speed			T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
Body Angular acceleration		T 		X,Y,Z/
Body Acceleration Magnitude		T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
X,Y,ZGravity Acceleration Magnitude	T 		X,Y,Z/
Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude	T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
Body Angular Speed Magnitude		T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z
Body Angular Acceleration Magnitude	T/F		X,Y,Z/X,Y,Z

The signal data are normalized to estimate the following set of variables, creating a total of 561 
variables. 
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Auto-regression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between two vectors.

Measurements:
Following the guidelines for a tidy dataset with respect to having descriptive variable names, because 
no two variables can have the same name and the description should not be abbreviated, or have any 
special characters (especially those that could create problem for R compiling or executing, like 
parenthesis) I concluded the best approach is to use names that are close to the original names and 
yet clear enough to read and distinguish from similar names. Original variables (features) names are 
modified to have a capital first letter for each word in the name string. All special characters are 
removed, as well. Following are a smaple of the modified variable names.

Note: It would have been better if we could include the axis in a paranthesis after a function, e.g. 
Mean(X). But R cannot distinguish variables with () from a function. 

Procedure for creating the tidy data set:
This process has three phases. Phase one is done in question 1. It builds on the original data set and 
adds the variable names and subject IDs to the measurement data frames for each of test and training 
subsets separately and then merges the two tables (named, test_train). In phase two, done in question 
4, the original variable names are modified to comply with the guidelines for a tidy dataset. 

Phase 3 is done after question 5. where the measurement values are grouped by each combination of 
(Subject, Activity) and the statics functions (average/mean, min, median, max, and standard deviation) 
are computed to summarize the measurement data for each variable.
